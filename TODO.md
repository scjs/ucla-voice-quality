* Green Hmong speakers are missing from the acoustics master spreadsheet (Hmong
speakers F1, F3, M2)
* Chinese glosses in the original PDF word lists for Yi are missing from the
three Yi tables
* Description of the `tone_misc` column is missing from the `egg` documentation
(originally the `Tone` column in the EGG master spreadsheet)
* IPA transcriptions of the same words have some inconsistencies across the
three Yi word lists
* These columns in `egg` have extreme values that are probably bad data:
`min_Vel`, `peak_Vel`, `ratio`, `SQ2_SQ1`, `SQ4_SQ3`
* The `SHR` column in `acoustics` has some zeros that indicate bad data and some
zeros that are valid measurements
